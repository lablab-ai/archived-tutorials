#### **PLEASE ENSURE YOU HAVE DONE THIS STEP BEFORE PROCEEDING, OTHERWISE NOTHING WILL WORK!**

## 💾 Installation

To install Auto-GPT, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have all the **requirements** listed above, if not, install/get them

_To execute the following commands, open a CMD, Bash, or Powershell window by navigating to a folder on your computer and typing `CMD` in the folder path at the top, then press enter._

2. Clone the repository: For this step, you need Git installed. Alternatively,
   you can download the [latest stable release](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/releases/latest) (`Source code (zip)`, bottom of the page).

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT.git
    ```

3. Navigate to the directory where the repository was downloaded

    ```bash
    cd Auto-GPT
    ```

4. Install the required dependencies

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. Configure Auto-GPT
   1. Locate the file named `.env.template` in the main `/Auto-GPT` folder.
   2. Create a copy of this file, called `.env` by removing the `template` extension.  The easiest way is to do this in a command prompt/terminal window `cp .env.template .env`.
   3. Open the `.env` file in a text editor.  _Note: Files starting with a dot might be hidden by your Operating System._
   4. Find the line that says `OPENAI_API_KEY=`.
   5. After the `"="`, enter your unique OpenAI API Key (without any quotes or spaces).
   6. Enter any other API keys or Tokens for services you would like to utilize.
   7. Save and close the `.env` file.

   By completing these steps, you have properly configured the API Keys for your project.
   
   ## 🔧 Usage

1. Run `autogpt` Python module in your terminal.
  On linux or mac:
    ```bash
    # On Linux of Mac:
   ./run.sh start
   # On Windows:
   ./run.bat start
   ```
   Running with `--help` after `start` lists all the possible command line arguments you can pass.

2. After each action, choose from options to authorize command(s),
exit the program, or provide feedback to the AI.
   1. Authorize a single command, enter `y`
   2. Authorize a series of _N_ continuous commands, enter `y -N`
   3. Exit the program, enter `n`
